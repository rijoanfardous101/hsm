This journey inspired me to write and publish a book. Upon returning to Bangladesh, I joined an international organization as a health systems researcher and later transitioned to another global entity, where I’ve worked with pride for over 26 months as a health systems expert. In 2022, the birth of my second daughter brought immense joy to our family. In 2024, I founded Health Systems Matter, a platform to advance my vision for impactful contributions in the health sector.",

        My Personal Journey So Far
      </h3>

      {/* content */}
      <div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify pt-4">
          I was born into a typical Bangladeshi family, where high expectations
          shaped my childhood as an only child. Without strong guidance or role
          models in my broader family, I learned to dream and build a meaningful
          life on my own.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify pt-4">
          My perspective shifted during my undergraduate years, largely
          influenced by books. Hillary Clinton's autobiography, particularly her
          statement, "Learn from the world what you cannot learn from your
          parents," inspired my journey of self-discovery and lifelong learning.
          Since then, I have drawn knowledge and inspiration from books,
          relationships, nature, personal experiences, and formal education.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify pt-4">
          Academically, I earned three Master's degrees from international
          universities on scholarships. Yet, my most valuable lessons stem from
          practical experiences and observations. My transformation—from a
          guideless child to a public health professional—is also the story of
          becoming an organizer, builder, and writer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify pt-4">
          This journey has been filled with challenges and broken dreams, but my
          determination and resilience keep me moving forward. Two traits have
          defined my path. Patience during times of struggle, when I have little
          or nothing. Second, Attitude during times of abundance when life is
          generous.
