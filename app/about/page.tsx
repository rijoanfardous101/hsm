        "Q1: What inspired the establishment of Health Systems Matter, and what is its foundational background? Sizear: Two key factors inspired me to create the HSM knowledge platform. First, early in my career in public health, I faced significant challenges in accessing relevant documents on the Bangladesh health system. Understanding its complexities and gaining a comprehensive overview was difficult due to the absence of a centralized resource. This experience underscored the need for a dedicated platform that systematically compiles both local and global health system insights. Recognizing this gap, I envisioned HSM as a continuously updated resource hub, ensuring professionals have easy access to the latest records in a welldocumented manner. ",
