            <span className="font-bold">HSM:</span> Two key factors inspired me
            to create the HSM knowledge platform.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <span className="">First,</span> early in my career in public
            health, I faced significant challenges in accessing relevant
            documents on the Bangladesh health system. Understanding its
            complexities and gaining a comprehensive overview was difficult due
            to the absence of a centralized resource. This experience
            underscored the need for a dedicated platform that systematically
            compiles both local and global health system insights. Recognizing
            this gap, I envisioned HSM as a continuously updated resource hub,
            ensuring professionals have easy access to the latest records in a
            well-documented manner.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            <span className="">Second,</span> over time, I gained access to a
            wealth of resources, empirical experiences, expert interactions, and
            participation in conferences and seminars. This exposure enriched my
            understanding and made me resourceful. I realized that developing a
            knowledge platform could benefit both emerging and established
            professionals by addressing their information needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This realization led to the creation of HSM, with the goal of making
            health system knowledge more accessible and actionable.

          public health and development professionals become more knowledgeable

          <p className="mb-2">
            <span className="font-bold">HSM:</span> Funding is always a
            challenge. So far, we have not received external funding, nor have
            we actively pursued it. My priority has been to first assess the
            platform's impact and usability. For now, HSM operates entirely
            through volunteer support of mine.

            <span className="font-bold">HSM:</span> This is a tricky and tough
            question to answer, as my experience has been mixed—mostly positive,
            with a few less encouraging moments. However, I see value in all
            responses, as they offer valuable insights and appreciation. When I
            reach out to experts for technical contributions to HSM, they are
            generally welcoming and supportive, not just of me but of the
            platform's purpose. Many, even those I have never met personally,
            have responded positively, offering their commitment and expertise.

            My key takeaway is that meaningful initiatives attract strong
            support, even if some remain skeptical. I believe that, over time,
            they too will recognize the value of this work. I still believe,
            knowledge remains a powerful tool, and the world needs informed
            professionals to tackle complex public health challenges.
